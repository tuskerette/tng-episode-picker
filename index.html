  <summary>why?</summary>
  There is this great free TV channel that shows Star Trek every night, but now I'm moving and I packed my TV.
  <br>
  I can still watch Star Trek TNG online, but the beauty of watching it on TV is that they pick the episode for me,<br>
  and I don't have to waste time in the rabbit hole.
