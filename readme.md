There is this great free TV channel that shows Star Trek every night, but now I'm moving and I packed my TV.

I can still watch Star Trek TNG online, but the beauty of watching it on TV is that they pick the episode for me, and I don't have to waste time in the rabbit hole.

So I made [this](http://www.tuskerette.com/projects/tng-episode-picker)

You're welcome :)

### Install
run `npm install`

to run the jest test, run `jest <name-of-file.test.js>`

### To do
- [ ] add test with jest, just because
- [ ] fetch episode title/info from some API (?)
- [ ] link to watch on netflix/amazon prime video (?)
